# Installation
Those files a rely on python so you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
## Dependencies
Those files **are not** using any **external ibraries** so in fact you **doesn't need** to install any packages. Just run the code and woola!
## Running and testing
Once you installed python, you can probably does this:
```
python
```
In case you got:
> python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
You **did not** install Python correctly. Reinstall Python if the problem still appears.

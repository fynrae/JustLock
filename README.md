# Installation
Those files a rely on python so you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
## Dependencies
Those files **are not** using any **external ibraries** so in fact you **doesn't need** to install any packages. Just run the code and woola!
## Running and testing
Once you installed python, you can probably does this:
```
python
```
In case you got:
> python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 

You **did not** install Python correctly. Reinstall Python if the problem still appears.

If you were able to run **python** without any error, please head to these step:
### Running and testing the files
Go the path of the files that you've downloaded, extract them and do this:
> python keygen.py

To run the keygen, I will ask for your username.

> python login.py

This will run the login form. To test, you will have to enter your username and the license code they have been generated from **keygen.py** file.
